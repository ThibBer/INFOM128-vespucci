# Rotating elements

Ways, multipolygons and multiple selected elements including Nodes can be rotated. Additionally individual Nodes with a "direction" tag can have the direction value set by rotation.

Drag the screen roughly in a circle and the element will be rotated the appropriate amount. Clicking the "check" button will save the changes, selecting the "back" arrow will abort the action.
